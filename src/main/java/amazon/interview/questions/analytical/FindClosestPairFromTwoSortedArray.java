Find the closest pair from two sorted arrays
Given two sorted arrays and a number x, find the pair whose sum is closest to x and the pair has
an element from each array.

We are given two arrays ar1[0…m-1] and ar2[0..n-1] and a number x, we need to find the pair ar1[i] + ar2[j]
such that absolute value of (ar1[i] + ar2[j] – x) is minimum.

Example:

Input:  ar1[] = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        ar2[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
        x = 32
Output:  1 and 30

Input:  ar1[] = {1, 4, 5, 7};
        ar2[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
        x = 50
Output:  7 and 40

                ", " + ar2[res_r] + "]");
